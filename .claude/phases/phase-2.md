# Phase 2: Requirements & Scope

**Goal:** Define exactly what will be built before designing how.

After each step: update task tracking markdown file in the project's `todo/` folder

## Steps

### 1. User Stories
*(Critical - drives everything downstream)*

- Write user stories in format: "As a [role], I want [feature] so that [benefit]"
- Each story must be testable and independently deliverable
- User stories directly inform acceptance criteria
- User stories define the behavioral flows that require 100% test coverage

### 2. Acceptance Criteria
- Derive directly from user stories
- Each criterion must be verifiable through integration/E2E tests
- These become the test scenarios in Phase 5

### 3. Functional Requirements
- List specific behaviors/features the solution must have
- Map each requirement back to its user story

### 4. Scope Boundaries
- Explicitly state what is IN scope
- Explicitly state what is OUT of scope
- Get user confirmation on scope boundaries

### 5. Questions Checkpoint
- Surface all remaining questions before proceeding
- Wait for user confirmation that requirements are complete

## Exit Criteria
- User stories written and approved
- Acceptance criteria defined
- IN/OUT scope explicitly stated
- User confirmed requirements are complete
